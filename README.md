Introduction

PSAK is a project that targets a very specific audience

PSAK must be developed with inexperience in mind while maintaining functional dynamics. In other words, it should be operable by a "script kiddie" with strong reading comprehension, while a seasoned pen-tester should not become frustrated with overly limited options. However, it is not meant to fully replace original tools such as "nmap" or "metasploit". Such a project is beyond the scope of the tasks at hand.

PSAK must be modular and easily expandable. This is because the founding developers cannot possibly integrate every single Linux-based security-oriented application into it. In addition, to remain relevant means to expand and grow. PSAK will not be a project to invest in as a developer or a user if it does not evolve in a positive manner. Some tools stagnate in their development, causing users to shy away from them and developers to ignore them. Clearly, the ability to evolve is crucial to PSAK's relevancy in the years to come.
